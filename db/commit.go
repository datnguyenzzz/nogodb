// Inspired by PebbleDB
// The commit pipeline is the component which manages the steps in
// committing write batches, e.g writing the batch to the WAL and
// applying its contents to the memtable.
//
// If concurrent performance was not a concern, the commit pipeline could
// simply be a mutex which synchnously writes to the WAL and application
// of the batch records to the memtable. But we want to challenge ourself here :)
//
// The primary challenge in concurrent performance in the commit pipeline
// is maintaining 2 invariants:
// 1. Batches need to be written to the WAL in sequence number order.
// 2. Batches need to be made visible for reads in sequence number
//    order. This invariant arises from the use of a single sequence
//    number which indicates which mutations are visible.
//
// So we have four steps in committing a write batch:
// 1. Write the batch to the WAL
// 2. Apply the mutations in the batch to the memtable
// 3. Bump the visible sequence number
// 4. Sync the WAL
//
// Writing the batch to the WAL is actually very fast as it is just a
// memory copy. Applying the mutations in the batch to the memtable is by
// far the most CPU intensive part of the commit pipeline. Syncing the
// WAL is the most expensive from a wall clock perspective.
//
// The commit pipeline looks like:
// 1. Lock commit mutex
//   * Add batch to commit queue
//   * Assign batch sequence number
//   * Write batch to the WAL
// 2. Unlock commit mutex
// 3. Apply batch to memtable (concurrently)
// 4. Publish batch sequence number
